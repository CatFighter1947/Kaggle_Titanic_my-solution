My solution to the popular problem about the wreck of the Titanic with Kaggle. 
Since I'm just learning, the main goal of this project for me was to understand the data, learn how to do preprocessing, try existing classification algorithms in sklearn, evaluate these models, and also try to select hyperparameters for the model.    
The main code is contained in the file kaggle_Titanic.py
test.csv, train.csv, gender_submission.csv are datasets that can also be downloaded from the competition website: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data
submission.csv - predicted data.
